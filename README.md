## Minireg
Minireg is a voltage regulator for the Wii U, supporting 1S lithium battery setups or 3v-5v input from a power supply.
It is based of YveltalGriffins bistro regulator board which you can find [here](https://github.com/mackieks/bistro).

It is intended to be used with the WUP-50, however it should also work on the previous board revisions (WUP-01 to WUP-40).
